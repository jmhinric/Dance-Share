### Overview

**Dance Share** is a Yelp-like application that allows users to write reviews for modern dance concerts. 

Dance Share uses:
* [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/getting_started) with the [OAuth gem](http://oauth.rubyforge.org/)to structure and standardize venue information.
* The [Fuzzily gem](https://github.com/mezis/fuzzily) is do fuzzy searching for users, dance pieces, and various other information internal to the app.

Dance Share was developed as a project for General Assembly's 12-week Web Development Immersive program.
